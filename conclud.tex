This paper considers the problem of incorporating ever-increasing auxialiary data from machine learning techniques such as textual analysis into the estimation of large covariance matrices. 
This current version is preliminary with ongoing research on the following  applications.

Firstly, we are applying the covaraince estimation technique on portfolio construction, following the problem considered in \cite{ledoit2004HoneyShrunk} and \cite{ledoit2017NonlinearShrinkage}, where the estimation of the sparse covaraince matrices are vital for constructing the minimum-variance portfolio. 

Secondly, the method can be applied to study spatial-APT under large \(N\) case. \cite{kou2018asset} finds that common risk factors are insufficient to capture all the significant inter-dependencies in asset returns, and local interactions are also important.  Spatial-APT and spatial CAPM type of models have not been popular in large N case since the measure of contiguity is challenging. Our method can uncover contemporaneously correlated entities by combining market-based information and auxiliary network information, thus providing a natural contiguity measure. Relying solely on either statistical methods or external network information is not as desirable as the links identified by the former are hard to interpret and the external network may miss some important links.

Thirdly, we are expanding the set of auxialiary networks beyond the Hoberg's network as well as applying the technique on larger datasets. We have collected IBES analysts cocovarage network and are constructing new network based on firms' characteristics. The flexibility of the methods allows us many potential improvements.
