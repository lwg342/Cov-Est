In this section, we apply the adaptive correlation thresholding method to a portfolio construction problem. First we describe the procedure and then present some of the results we have. 

Assume we observe the excess return \(Y_{it}\), \(i = 1,\dots,N\) and \(t= 1,\dots, T\) follows
\begin{equation*}
    Y_{it} = B_{i}' F_{t} + u_{it} ; \quad \Sigma_{u} = E(u_{t}u_{t}')
\end{equation*}
where \(F_{t}\) are factor excess returns. Here we have considered Fama-French 3 and the Carhart's momentum factor. The goal is to estimate \(\Sigma_{Y} = E\pqty{YY'}\) and use that estimate to construct portfolio following \cite{ledoit2017NonlinearShrinkage}. The auxialiary network we have include the \cite{hoberg2016TextBasedNetwork}'s network(henceforth Hoberg's Network) and IBES analysts cocoverage network. Here we present the results for SP500 returns using Hoberg's Network. 

The procedure we take is as follows. 
\begin{enumerate}
    \item We run time series linear regressions of \(Y_{it}\) on \(F_{k,t}\), obtain the beta estimates \(\hat{B}_{i}\) and the residual \(\hat{u}_{it}\). 
    \item Compute the covaraince matrix \(S_{\hat{u}} = \frac{1}{T}\hat{u}\hat{u}'\) and \(S_{F} = \frac{1}{T} \sum_{t} (F_{t} - \bar{F})(F_{t} - \bar{F})'\) and appply \textit{adaptive correlation thresholding} on \(S_{\hat{u}}\), denote the estimate as \(\hat{S}_{\hat{u}}\). 
where the second step adaptive correlation thresholding is achieved in the following way. Let \(R_{u}\) be the correlation matrix calculated from \(S_{u}\). We use soft thresholding \(h(r_{ij}, \tau_{ij}) = \sign\pqty{r_{ij}} \pqty{r_{ij} - \tau_{ij}}_{+}\) on the off-diagonal elemetns \(r_{ij}\) of \(R_{u}\), where 
\begin{equation*}
    \tau_{ij} = \delta_{ij} \sqrt{\frac{\log N}{T}}
\end{equation*}
and 
\begin{equation*}
    \delta_{ij} = a + b G_{ij}
\end{equation*}

% \blue{(so that the network is a little denser, and I have also considered specification of \(\delta\) as a probit model, but it complicates the optimization part because the constraint is nonlinear.)}. 

Let the threshold estimate be \(\hat{R}_{\hat{u}}(a,b)\), given \(a,b\), our estimate will be
\begin{equation*}
    \hat{S}_{\hat{u}} = \hat{S}_{\hat{u}}(a,b) = \diag(S_{\hat{u}})^{\frac{1}{2}} \hat{R}_{\hat{u}}\diag(S_{\hat{u}})^{\frac{1}{2}}
\end{equation*}

In order to guarantee positive definiteness, I follow the suggestion in \cite{fan2015OverviewEstimation} and \cite{fan2013LargeCovariance}, by first finding the minimum \(\underline{\delta}\) such that the \(\hat{S}(\delta, 0)\) has its smallest eigenvalue larger than \(0\) if we choose \(\tau_{ij} = \underline{\delta} \sqrt{\frac{\log N}{T}}\). 

Then \(a,b\) are estimated using cross-validation following \cite{bickel2008CovarianceRegularization} by randomly spliting the sample \(V\) times, for each \(v = 1,\dots,V\), compute the estimate \(\hat{S}^{1,v}_{u}\) with the first subsample, and sample covariance estimate \(\hat{\Sigma}^{2,v}_{u}\) with the second subsample and let the criterion function be
\begin{equation*}
    L(a, b) = \frac{1}{V} \sum_{v}^{V} \norm{\hat{S}^{1,v}_{u} - \hat{\Sigma}^{2,v}_{u}}^{2}_{F}
\end{equation*}
we find \(\hat{a},\hat{b}\) that minimise this criterion subject to the constraints:
\begin{align}
    0 \leq a \sqrt{\frac{\log N}{T}} &\leq 1 \\
    b \sqrt{\frac{\log N}{T}} &\leq 0 \\
    \underline{\delta} &\leq a + b 
\end{align}
\item Construct an estimate of \(\Sigma_{Y}\) by \(\hat{\Sigma}_{Y} = \hat{B}S_{F}\hat{B}' +\hat{S}_{\hat{u}}\)
\end{enumerate}

We have estimated the covariance matrices of SP500 stocks from 1996 to the end of 2017; using stock return data and Fama-French 3 factor returns \(F_{kt}, k =1,2,3\). We incorporate Hoberg's network \(G_{t}\) that are updated yearly into our estimation procedure. 

The Hoberg's Network is a yearly updated \(N\times N\) network with elements in \([0,1]\) with higher score \(G_{ij}\) reflecting potentially higher correlation between the \(i\)-th and \(j\)-th firms.


In Figure 1, we present the distribution, we present the distribution (blue) of sample covariance estimates \(S_{\hat{u}, ij}\) of residuals after regressing the the stocks returns on the Fama-French 3 factor for the stocks that haIn Figure 1, we present the distribution (blue) of sample covariance estimates \(S_{\hat{u}, ij}\) of residuals after regressing the the stocks returns on the Fama-French 3 factor for the stocks tsiduals after regressing the the stocks returns on the Fama-French 3 factor for the stocks that have no missing data in the dataset; alongwith the distribution of  sample covariance \(S_{\hat{u},ij}\) for those \(ij\) with \(G_{ij} > 0\) in the Hoberg's network. It's clear that the distribution is shifted to the right, implying that Hoberg's network can pick up information that are not explained by the factors.

Then we use a rolling-window estimation, with 252-day estimation period and then move the window forward by 21 days. In the estimation periods in window  \(m= 1, \dots,M\) we construct estimate \(\hat{\Sigma}_{Y,m} = \hat{B}S_{F}\hat{B}' + \hat{S}_{\hat{u}}\pqty{\hat{a}_{m}, \hat{b}_{m}}\). The estimated parameters \(\hat{a}_{m},\hat{b}_{m} \)  have mean \((1.177, -0.252)\), where the \(\hat{b}\) measures the effect of knowing the auxiliary network on the thresholding level.
